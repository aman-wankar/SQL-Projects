Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000  
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 8090(business_id), 9581(user_id), 10000(id)
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 6493(business_id), 10000(id)
viii. Tip = 3979(business_id), 573(user_id)
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
    SELECT *
    FROM user
    WHERE (
		id
		OR name
		OR review_count
		OR yelping_since
		OR useful
		OR funny
		OR cool
		OR fans
		OR average_stars
		OR compliment_hot
		OR compliment_more
		OR compliment_profile
		OR compliment_cute
		OR compliment_list
		OR compliment_note
		OR compliment_plain
		OR compliment_cool
		OR compliment_funny
		OR compliment_writer
		OR compliment_photos
		) IS NULL
	
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1.0		max: 5		avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min: 1		max: 53		avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min: o		max: 2000		avg: 24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	it is not necessary that posing more reviews can  result in more fans.
	because as Gerald has posed the most reviews, he has fewer fans than Mimi.
	so fans cannot be determined by counting review_count

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	City = Mesa     Category = Food
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	Yes

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
    Yes  
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	By running the query we can infer that in Mesa city, business with more number of open hours performs 
	well as compare to the business with less number of operating hours  
SQL code used for analysis:
select
business.name
, business.city
, category.category
, business.stars
, hours.hours
, business.review_count
, business.postal_code
from (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id) inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
where business.city = 'Mesa' 
group by business.stars;

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:business that are still open have more reviews
         
         
ii. Difference 2:business that are still open have more working hours
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
select
business.name
, business.is_open
, category.category
, business.stars
, hours.hours
, business.review_count
, business.postal_code
from (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id) inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
where business.city = 'Mesa' 
 group by business.is_open;

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
Comparing two category of business.           
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
when someone come up with ideas of doing any new business or startup, they want to know about their target
areas and we can tell them by analysing data that what sort of priority they shold give to that areas they have 
choose to focus on to grow their business.
in this example we are comparing two types of business shopping & food. we will compare them on the basis of star ratings review count.
from this analysis we can infer that food category Business are more engaging than shopping according to 
star ratings and review count. 
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
